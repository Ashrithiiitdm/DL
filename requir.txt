Compiler Design:

Lexical analyser implementation in C ‐ Lexical analyser implementation using
LEX tool Recursive descent parser implementation in C for an expression
grammar ‐ YACC and LEX based implementation for an expressions grammar
‐ YACC implementation of a calculator that takes an expression with digits, +
and * and computes and prints its value ‐ Front end implementation of a compiler
that generates the three address code for a simple language‐ Back end
implementation of a compiler which takes the three address code (output of
previous exercise) and results in assembly language instructions ‐
Implementation of peephole optimization in C.
